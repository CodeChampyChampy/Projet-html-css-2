# Projet-html-css-2
Page web chambres d'hôtes.

Hello everyone, this is my second HTML/CSS project.

This project is the creation of a B&B reservation website for Clos Marsault as part of an online HTML/CSS course taught by "From Scratch - Le développement Web de zéro".
It includes a "home page", a "contact us" section, and is in French.
